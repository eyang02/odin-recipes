            <li>4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</i>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
            <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>Roux:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. 
                Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. 
                This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. 
                Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Gumbo:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. 
                Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. 
                Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. 
                Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.</li>
            <li>Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. 
                Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
